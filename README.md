# Finding Darwin

This is my Senior Project based on Karl Sims' paper Evolving Virtual Creatures.  

Currently, the world that runs is minimal with a small plane that the camera can walk on.  Use WASD keys to move and the mouse to look around.

src/CreatureGraph.h contains the data structures that will be used to represent a creature's genotype.
